# Kismet-Shop
An OO-PHP Model Of A Shop Named Kismet. 

 The Task :
Kismet shop is a shop owned by Mariam, and run by her four intelligent staff.
Rukayat and Aminat are the attendants who sell stuff and collect the cash,
Aurora (the Latina) is the manager, responsible also for acquisition and general
inventory management. 

The stud, Ahmed, is doubles as security and cleaner.

Kismet offers discounts on all 'Local made' products, up to 15% when you buy
above $15 - each product has its own discount which adds up at checkout when
necessary. 

Kismet keeps a small log of their customers' preferences so that
Rukayat or Aminat can show the customers to the right pew when they arrive.
Model this scenario with all entities using OO-PHP.
